# Browser-Extension
## Objective
The goal of this task is to evaluate installed browser extensions, identify potentially harmful or unused ones, and improve browser security by removing them. This helps develop awareness of privacy risks related to browser add-ons.

## Steps Performed

1. **Accessed Browser Extension Settings**
   - Visited `chrome://extensions/` in the Chrome browser.

2. **Reviewed All Extensions**
   - Evaluated each extension’s purpose, permissions, publisher, and user ratings.
   - Paid close attention to those with:
     - Broad access permissions (e.g., “Read and change all your data on all websites”)
     - Unknown developers or poor reviews

3. **Identified and Removed Risky Extensions**
   - Removed the following extension:
     - `PDF Viewer Plus` – Unknown developer, unused, and unnecessary.
   - Restarted the browser after removal to observe performance improvements.

4. **Captured Evidence**
   - Took a screenshot of the updated extension list for documentation.

## Key Learnings

- Some browser extensions request excessive permissions that can lead to privacy or security concerns.
- Extensions with unclear origin or aggressive behavior can act as spyware or inject ads/malware.
- Regular audits of installed extensions are necessary to maintain browser security and performance.

## Security Insights

### How Can Extensions Be Dangerous?
- They can read website content, log keystrokes, or redirect traffic.
- Malicious extensions may steal credentials, show fake pop-ups, or manipulate site content.

### Suspicious Permission Red Flags:
- "Access data on all websites"
- "Manage downloads"
- "Read browsing history"

### Best Practices
- Only install extensions from verified developers with high ratings.
- Review permissions during installation.
- Remove unused extensions periodically.
- Report suspicious extensions to browser support.

## Conclusion

This task reinforced the importance of maintaining browser hygiene by regularly reviewing installed extensions. Extensions, while useful, can also be a major security risk if not carefully managed. By identifying and removing suspicious or unnecessary extensions, users can significantly reduce their exposure to potential attacks, improve browser performance, and maintain better control over their privacy. Regular checks, along with cautious installation practices, are essential habits for cybersecurity-aware individuals.
